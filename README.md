# Skifree.js

This is a customized version of the JavaScript port of [SkiFree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skifree) by [Chris Pirih](http://ski.ihoc.net/).

[**Play it here!**](https://astralproxy.github.io/skifree.js) (opens a new page).

## Features so far:

* Skiing down a never-ending skislope with randomly-generated trees which do not have transparent backgrounds
* Collision detection with trees - and the appropriate reaction
* Turning left and right
* Stopping
* MONSTAHS! GRAAAAHHH! They even eat you and then run away because they're full
* Distance tracking so you can see how far you've gone, you absolute badass
* Speed boost (this was a little-known feature to get away from monsters) using the F key
* **MOBILE SUPPORT** - This is cool - try loading the [**the demo page**](http://basicallydan.github.com/skifree.js) on a mobile device and then use your finger to direct the skier around the piste. Also try double-tap ;)
* Rainbow jump platforms & jumping - though a couple of improvements could be made
* LocalStorage high-score (thanks, [@ddoolin](https://github.com/ddoolin)!)
* Custom-sized Hitboxes
* Big trees & crashing into them both whilst skiing and jumping

## So, what's left to do?

This is what I'm gonna do, probably in this order. Who the hell knows. There are other features to the original game but I'm not going to add them to the list until I've gotten through this one.

* Rocks
* Snowboarders
* Dogs
* Ski Lifts

Some features which weren't in the original which I'd like to give a go:

* Being a snowboarder instead of a boring old skier
* Tricks, or something?
* Multiplayer (ooooo wouldn't that be fun?!)

## Third-party credits

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) provided a bunch of useful markup and stuff
* [Wing Wang Wao](http://spriters-resource.com/submitter/Wing%20Wang%20Wao) of the [Spriters Resource Forum](http://spriters-resource.com) did an amazing job of providing the sprites which I have extended slightly. Thanks!
* Thank you [Chris Pirih](http://ski.ihoc.net/) for making the original.
